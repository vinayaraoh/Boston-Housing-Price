In this project, I apply basic statistical and machine learning concepts on the data for housing prices in Boston, United States. By analyzing various features of houses, such as  number of rooms and river bounding tracts, this project provides valuable insights for potential buyers or sellers in estimating housing prices. 

First, I perform exploratory data analysis to uncover interesting patterns in the data. I then perform a simple linear regression to find the relationship between the housing price and the number of rooms, a feature strongly correlated with it. I then test a hypothesis about the data - will having a river bound a tract increase the housing price? How confident are we about this hypothesis? Finally, if a city planner wants to add new features to the city, how will it affect the housing price? I have laid out a design for testing the effect of adding a metro line to the city.
