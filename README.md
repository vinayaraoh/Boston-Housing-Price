The dataset used for the project comprises of housing data for suburbs in the city of Boston in the United States. In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns in the data. I then perform simple linear regression to find the relationship between the number of rooms, a strongly correlated feature and the housing price. I conclude with testing a hypothesis about the effect of having a river bounding the tract on the housing price and building a design for testing the effect of potential new features on the housing price.
